## Price vs. Rating Correlation  
**Question:** Do cheaper products get better reviews?

From the scatter plot *“Discount vs. Rating Correlation”*, there’s **no strong visible trend** showing that cheaper products receive better reviews.  
Ratings remain fairly consistent across different price ranges, typically clustering between **3.5 and 4.5 stars**.  

This suggests that **price does not significantly affect rating quality**, customers tend to rate products based on **performance, quality, and usability** rather than cost.  
In other words, lower-priced items do not automatically lead to higher customer satisfaction.

**Key takeaway:**  
> Product quality and customer experience influence ratings more than pricing.

## Discount Effect  
**Question:** Do higher discounts lead to higher sales or better ratings?

The *“Discount vs. Rating Correlation”* chart also shows that **larger discounts (50–80%) do not consistently result in higher ratings**.  
Products with extremely high discounts often maintain **average ratings around 4.0**, similar to products with smaller or moderate discounts.  

However, categories offering **moderate discounts (around 30–50%)** tend to have **better engagement**. This is likely because these discounts appear more trustworthy or balanced to customers.  
This pattern implies that **discounts can help attract attention and drive sales volume**, but **do not necessarily improve customer satisfaction or perceived quality**.

**Conclusion:**  
> Discounts are effective marketing tools for engagement, but not direct indicators of better customer feedback.

## Category Performance  
**Question:** Which product categories have the best ratings?

From the *“Top Product Categories by Average Rating”* visual, the highest-rated categories include:

- **Tablets**  
- **Basic**  
- **Coffee Presses**  
- **Cord Management**  
- **Film**

These categories achieved **average ratings above 4.3**, indicating **strong customer satisfaction and product consistency**.  
Interestingly, these are not necessarily the most popular or most-reviewed categories, but they perform exceptionally well in terms of **quality perception** and **customer approval**.

**Conclusion:**  
> Niche or specialized product categories often achieve the highest satisfaction levels due to consistent quality and customer expectations.

## Review Count Distribution  
**Question:** Which products get the most engagement?

The *“Most Reviewed Product Categories”* chart shows that the categories with the **highest review volumes** are:

- **USB Cables**  
- **Remote Controls**  
- **Instant Water Heaters**  
- **Smart Watches**

These items dominate in terms of review volume, indicating **high demand and frequent purchases**.  
They likely represent **everyday or widely used consumer goods**, explaining why they accumulate so much feedback compared to smaller or niche categories.

**Conclusion:**  
> Everyday tech accessories and practical household items drive the most customer engagement.

## Overall Insights  

- **Price** has little to no correlation with **rating quality** — customers value usefulness over cost.  
- **High discounts** increase visibility but don’t guarantee better satisfaction.  
- **Niche categories** such as Tablets and Coffee Presses outperform mainstream ones in **rating averages**.  
- **Common tech accessories** generate the highest **review counts**, reflecting strong sales and engagement.
